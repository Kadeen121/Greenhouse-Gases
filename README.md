# Greenhouse-Gases
## Introduction
Greenhouse gases issue has  plagued to our planet to warm the melt ice caps extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, blizzards and rainstorms.  This has a devastating effect on the planet espcially the on the nations that are developing and underdeveloped as they do not have the resource to combat the effects from climate change which is caused by greenhouse gases. In this project explore greenhouse gas emmissions  from 1990 to 2018, what industries  are producing the most greenhouse gases and attempt to build a model which will help give us clues in lowering GHG in the future.  

## Use

## Objective 
* Explore total GHG emissions from 1990 to 2019 by country
*
